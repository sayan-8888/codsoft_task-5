## Code Explanation:-
The code implements a Student Course Registration System in Java. It has `Course` and `Student` classes, representing individual courses and students. The system allows students to register for or drop courses, provided that the course capacity permits. Students can also view the courses they are enrolled in. The main class, `StudentCourseRegistrationSystem`, manages databases of courses and students using `HashMap`, and provides options for users to display available courses, register for or drop a course, and display registered courses. The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple operations until the user chooses to exit.
